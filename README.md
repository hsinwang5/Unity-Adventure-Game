# Unity Adventure Game
This was a prototype game back when I was still learning the basics of programming. I wanted to get familiar with C# in Unity as well as object-oriented programming so I assembled this prototype. It took about a week to get familiar with Unity's API and another week to make this prototype. It featured a custom camera as well as basic seek-and-find AI.
